Pri‐
marily, the Decorator is used when you want to add functionality to existing objects
without affecting the other objects. If you have painstakingly created a website format
for a customer with key components that work flawlessly, you don’t want to have to
upset the applecart when new functionalities are requested. For example, suppose your
customers want to include video functionality in their websites after you have built all
of the components originally requested. Instead of reworking your original compo‐
nents, you could “decorate” existing components with video functionality. In this way,
you can maintain the original functionality while adding new functionality.
Another important feature of the Decorator design pattern can be found in projects
where sometimes you need decoration and other times you don’t. Suppose your fun‐
damental site development model works just dandy with the majority of your customers.
However, some want certain functionality that will help their particular needs. Not
everyone wants or needs these additional functionalities. As a developer, you want to
create sites that will meet their business goals, and so you need what the business schools
call customerization—features unique to a specific business. With the Decorator pattern,
you can include both the core functionality and then “decorate” those cores with func‐
tionality unique to the customer.
With the change that constantly occurs on the Web and Internet—not to mention the
scope—the Decorator can be a huge asset in your kit of developer tools. It is a case where
you can have your cake and eat it, too—or at least decorate it with sprinkles.
