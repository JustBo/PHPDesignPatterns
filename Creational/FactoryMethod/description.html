    <b>When to Use the Factory Method</b>
  In part, design patterns are selected based on what you want to be able to change. In
  Chapter 3, Table 3-1 shows that the Factory Method should be used when the subclass
  of an object instantiated can vary. In the examples in this chapter, all of the subclasses
  of the Project interface vary; they are different countries. As you will see, the projects
  developed are objects made up of text (write-ups) and graphics (maps). At the outset,
  we assume that the developer does not know how many countries there will be. In other
  words, the number and types of objects are unknown. A class cannot anticipate the
  number of objects it must create, and so you do not want the class tightly bound to the
  classes it may have to create.
  If a class has a finite and known number of objects it must create, the class can be built
  so that the finite number of objects can be created in a predictable manner. For example,
  if you are making a world map application with separate objects for the seven continents,
  you can be fairly certain that they are not going to vary. On the other hand, if you are
  creating a site for different species of insects, you can be fairly certain that new ones will
  be discovered, change, and become extinct over a relatively short period of time. A
  programming product to deal with that kind of variation needs to have a good deal of
  flexibility built into it. This is the kind of project where you would want to consider
  using a Factory Method design.
